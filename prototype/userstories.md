**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. The platform can compile and send activity data to the relevant stakeholders in a secure and compliant data format (e.g., API contract).
2. Activity data included in scope â†’ see data model.
3. The system can automatically pull the latest data from the SDEP to the CA.

2. Data is sent (push) to SDEP endpoints ensuring data integrity.
3. The back-end API for storing host data has been developed, deployed, and tested to confirm data integrity and security.
4. Data is received (get) from SDEP endpoints for the Competent Authority.


# User Story 3.2: Area List Updates

*As a Competent Authority, I want to update the list of areas requiring registration so that the STR platform can check the veracity of the host declaration regarding the existence of registration in their area.*

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Competent Authorities can update the list of areas requiring registration through the system interface.
2. The system updates the area list dynamically, reflecting new data.
3. Member States are able to provide an API to call a Shapefile via the SDEP to the STR Platforms.
4. Optional: Member States are able to provide an API to give the list of postcodes or other data of the STR area's via the SDEP to the STR Platforms if the shapefile approach is not suited. To be discussed.

**Definition of Done:**
1. STR platform (or system) Lists of registration areas/ numbers dynamically updated upon receiving new data. The update is triggered manually and no reaction time is indicated. 

# User Story 3.3:  Dispatching Activity Data

*As a Competent Authority I want to get the activity data of the assigned STR Unit's in my Area.*

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Definition of Done:**
1. An API contract is defined and agreed upon between the Competent Authority and the SDEP, that enables sharing Activity data. (See datamodel)
2. The functionality for the SDEP to ensure that only those Competent Authorities in charge of registration processes and the development and enforcement of local rules receive platform data.
3. The SDEP Platform's back-end is capable of receiving, acknowledging, processing, and responding to receiving activity data.

# User Story 4.1: Share Listings flagged in random checks

*As an STR platform, I want to comply with the regulation by performing random checks on listings and flag and communicate possible invalid listings to Competent Authorities via the SDEP.
Competent Authorities are not expected to respond directly to these requests. Competent Authorities will be able to respond via users story 4.2.*

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Listings with invalid or non-existing registration numbers flagged during the random check phase (to be defined), and the listings are sent to SDEP.
2. SDEP dispatches data to the Competent Authority.

**Definition of Done:**
1. An API contract is defined and agreed upon between the Competent Authority and the STR Platform, that enables sharingURL, registration number and property address. (See datamodel)
2. The functionality for the STR Platform to send potential invalid listings is implemented and tested, ensuring data is transmitted securely.
3. The SDEP Platform's back-end is capable of receiving, acknowledging and processing flagged listings.

# User Story 4.2: Order Removal Based on Listing URL and/or Registration Number

*As a Competent Authority I want to be able to send removal orders from STR Platforms based on Listing URL and /or registration number.
