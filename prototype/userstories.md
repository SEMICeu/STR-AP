# User Story 3.3:  Dispatching Activity Data

*As a CA I want to get the activity data of the assigned STR Unit's in my Area*

**Acceptance Criteria:**

# User Story 4.1: Share Listings flagged in random checks

*As an STR platform, I want to comply to regulation of performing random check on the listings and flagg and communicate possible invalid listings to CA via the SDEP.

2. The functionality for the STR Platform to send potential invalid listings is implemented and tested, ensuring data is transmitted securely.
3. The SDEP Platform's back-end is capable of receiving, acknowledging, processing, and responding to flagged listings.

# User Story 4.2: Order Removal Based on Listing URL and/or Registration Number

*As a CA I want to be able to send orders to be removed from STR Platforms based on Listing URL and/or registration number.
