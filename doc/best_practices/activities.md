## 1.4. Activities 
The following **activities** were executed as part of the creation of the best practices and recommendations:

### 1.4.1. Preparation

The final scope and content of the Best Practices and Recommendations regarding Base Registries, the SDEP and data exchanges for Member States and/or Platforms were developed through an iterative approach, taking into account various activities and engagements.

* **Bilateral engagements**: Throughout the end of 2023 and the beginning of 2024, bilateral discussions were held with Member States and Platforms to gather insights and feedback on their experiences and best practices. These discussions helped refine the scope and focus of the best practices and recommendations.

* **Webinar 1 - Short-Term Rental Interoperability Solutions**: on the 30th of November 2023 a first webinar was organised to give a brief presentation and discuss the policy context, the main objectives of the working group, the project timeline and deliverables, the collaboration charter, governance structure, roles, and responsibilities, planning of upcoming meetings, followed by a Q&A session. The webinar aimed to discuss and seek insights and contributions from participants regarding the development of interoperability solutions for the short-term rental industry.

* **Webinar 2: Deep-Dive into STR registries**: On the 11th of January 2024, a  second webinar was organised to facilitate a comprehensive understanding on the data model, data architecture and data quality for base registries. This webinar provided an opportunity for Member States to share their expertise, exchange ideas, and contribute to the development of the best practices and recommendations.

* **Webinar 3 -  Deep-Dive into Data exchanges and the SDEP)**: On the 8th of February 2024, a webinar was organised to discuss the critical topics of the SDEP and Data exchanges within the STR framework. It emphasised the significance of these concepts in facilitating seamless interactions and secure data exchanges between online platforms and CA in the STR ecosystem. The session explored the concept of the SDEP and the role of it in the STR landscape. It also discussed the mechanisms and protocols for efficient and secure data exchanges between online platforms and CA.

* **Webinar 4 - Technical Deep Dive**: This webinar, that was organised on the 22nd of February 2024, aimed to provide participants with a detailed understanding of the SDEP and the technical aspects of data exchanges within the STR framework. The session focused on exploring the technical specifications of the SDEP and various data exchange mechanisms.

* Refinement of principles: During the ongoing iterative process, several principles will be established to guide the creation of the best practices and recommendations. These principles include:
  * **Conciseness**: The document focuses solely on the essential elements, ensuring a concise and streamlined presentation. Irrelevant or extraneous information is deliberately omitted to maintain clarity and relevance.
  * **Clarity**: The guide employs clear and well-defined terminology to enhance comprehension and facilitate ease of understanding. Ambiguity and confusion are minimised through the use of precise language and terminology.
  * **Fit-for-purpose**: The content of the guide is meticulously tailored to address the specific needs and requirements of the intended audience. By considering the unique circumstances and challenges faced by Member States and Platforms, the guide provides practical and relevant recommendations that can be effectively implemented.

By following this iterative approach and engaging with Member States and Platforms through bilateral discussions and by giving webinar, the Best Practices and Recommendations regarding Base Registries, the SDEP and Data Exchanges for Member States and Platforms were and will be further developed to provide valuable guidance and insights for the effective implementation and management of it. 

### 1.4.2. Community interactions

### 1.4.4. Webinars  
#### 1.4.4.1 Webinar 1: Short-Term Rental Interoperability Solutions 

The webinar aimed to discuss the Short-Term Rental (STR) framework and address the concerns and challenges faced by public authorities in regulating STR accommodations. The main objectives of the webinar were to quantify the concerns of the participants, gather their input, documentation, and support, and activate them in the working group. 

The webinar began by highlighting the challenges faced by public authorities, including the lack of reliable and accessible data, difficulties in enforcing rules and regulations, and unfair competition with other types of accommodations. To tackle these issues, the STR regulation was introduced to establish common rules and standards for data generation and sharing in the STR sector.

The regulation includes the implementation of a SDEP for data transmission and the introduction of random checks to combat fraud and illegal listings. The importance of interoperability, specifically semantic and technical interoperability, was emphasised to ensure a common understanding and format for data exchange between systems.

Throughout the webinar, participants were encouraged to provide their input and support for the working group that will be formed to further develop the framework and standards for data exchange and validation. The collaboration and active participation of the participants were deemed crucial in achieving the objectives of the regulation.

#### 1.4.4.2. Webinar 2: Deep-Dive into STR registries  

This webinar delved into the the topic of STR Base Registries. The webinar served as a platform to explore and share insights on the most effective approaches and strategies for managing base registries within the Member states. The discussions held during the webinar shed light on the significance of implementing robust data models, establishing efficient data architectures, and ensuring high data quality standards in base registry management.

During the webinar, the question regarding the presence of a data model  and preservation of data quality within Base Registries in each Member State was raised.  Furthermore, the Netherlands and Ireland presented a comprehensive overview of the short-term rental system in their country during the webinar. 


#### 1.4.4.3. Webinar 3: Deep-Dive into the SDEP and Data exchanges  

This webinar focused on the topic of the SDEP and data exchanges between the Member States and the STR Platforms. The SDEP will enable platforms to transmit activity data on a monthly basis to competent authorities. It will also allow platforms to assess the completeness of host declarations and conduct random checks on registration procedures. The efficient implementation of the regulation relies heavily on the Single Digital Entry Points. Furthermore, the goal of this webinar was to define the responsibilities of the Platforms, the Competent Authorities and Member States when aligning with the STR framework.

The significance of Member States and Platforms collaborating was highlighted in the beginning of the session by EUTravelTech This was followed by a presentation of Airbnb and Booking explaining the more technical details. They talked about three key areas: API documentation, ways of collaborating and ways of data collection and reporting. They highlighted the need for consistent API standards for registration and STR data transfers across the EU, since this would reduce implementation costs for all stakeholders involved. 

Concerning the ways of collaborating, they presented a timeline for cooperation on API Build, which was based on their previous experiences in building APIs for the exchange of data between them and governments. A standardised procedure on this was mentioned by them on this topic as well. They suggested a three phase time frame, where the initial period of six months would be dedicated to the construction of the API. This would be followed by a three-month after launch period to deal with the technical outages that would occur after launch. Lastly, a period of ongoing maintenance would happen to solve problems that might occur in a later stage. 
Also 5 use cases were presented where it involved the cooperation with online platforms: 

- Authorities sharing data about the areas where registration procedures apply
- Platforms sharing the STR activity data on a monthly basis
- Authorities sharing data about valid registration numbers and platforms conducting random checks
- Platforms sharing data about random checks results API
- Authorities submitting take-down requests

Important to mention is that the first 3 use cases are prescribed in the STR regulation, but they believe that use case 4-5 should be equally enabled by the SDEP to facilitate an effective and efficient implementation. 

Following the presentation of EUTravelTech, Airbnb and Booking.com, PwC presented their high-level best practices regarding the Single Digital Entry Point (SDEP) and the transmission of activity data through the SDEP. 

#### 1.4.4.4. Webinar 4: Technical Deep Dive  

This webinar focused on the technical specifications of the SDEP. It was emphasized that the presence of technical professionals was highly recommended to delve into the details and foster a collaborative environment for effective interoperable solutions. During the session, participants were encouraged to share their expertise, exchange ideas, and contribute to the development of effective interoperable solutions for the implementation of the STR framework.

The webinar covered several important topics related to SDEP and interoperability. The session began by highlighting the significance of interoperability in reducing system complexity. It was discussed how interoperability enables different systems to seamlessly communicate and exchange data, thereby enhancing efficiency and effectiveness within the ecosystem.  The webinar then delved into the role of API standards in achieving interoperability. During the session, several recommendations for  API standards were discussed:  communication protocols, Authentication, the data format, specific requests, response code and frequency actions. 

Towards the end of the webinar, participants were invited to take part in a survey to gather their feedback and insights. The aim of the survey is to  further the understanding of current practices, preferences, and challenges related to the STR framework.  This survey aims to identify common ground and areas of convergence, serving as a platform for open and constructive dialogue. The survey is mainly based on the slides presented during the technical deep dive.
